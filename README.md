# Student Instructions

Begin by **forking** this repo, then cloning down your forked copy to your machine. `cd` into the project directory from your terminal.


## Whateverly

1) Create a new file at: `/mod-2/whateverly/<yourCohortNumber>/<yourGitHubUsername>.js`

  * The project and cohort directories have already been created for you, double check that you are adding your new file to this pre-existing directory
  * Your GitHub username is the part of the URL when you go to your profile at `https://github.com/<yourUserName>` e.g. my username would be [brittanystoroz](https://github.com/brittanystoroz)

2) Your file should include 2 datasets, both assigned to variables that you export at the bottom of the file. Follow the structure of this [sample file](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/fe-apps/blob/master/mod-2/whateverly/1811/sample.js) to create yours. **Do not overwrite this file.**

3) Commit and push your changes. Open a pull request.

# Instructor Instructions


// webhooks for when a PR is submitted: https://developer.github.com/webhooks/ - can we validate they have module.exports at the bottom with two variables? can we run their JSON through a validator?


// git-hooks pre-commit hook to check that theyve only added a single file
